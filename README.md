# COVID-19 Vaccine Data

This is Orizzonti Politici's open data repo about covid-19 vaccinations. The project is still a work in progress and we shall frequently update (and even overhaul) the structure of the repo.

As of now, we are just manually retrieving the data by Italy's official vaccine data repository. Sources will be added soon.

## Structure

The directory `data` contains the data we plan to automatically update. The script we use to retrieve the data shall be `get-data.R`.

Other notebooks are attempts of visualising and manipulating the data.
